This is a program I'm making for my math IA.  
I'm writing it in C++ and its purpose is to find the total number of polygons that can be formed when a complete graph is made of a regular polygon.  
A complete graph is made when all vertices are connected to all other vertices.  
For instance, when a complete graph of a regular hexagon is created, there will be 24 small polys (18 triangles and 6 kites).
HOWEVER, these are only the most basic polygons, over 500 other polygons can be counted if adjacent polys are combined to create compound polygons.

This seeks for find the quantity of the latter.
